OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT
Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
  JavaScript’s primitive data-types
  =>Number,
  =>String,
  =>Boolean,
  =>null,
  =>undefined and symbol.
Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.An object, is a reference data type.
Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.

Objects and properties:
A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object.
Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. 
objectName.propertyName
Properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation (for more details see property accessors).
Objects are sometimes called associative arrays, since each property is associated with a string value that can be used to access it.

Creating Objects In JavaScript :

Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal:
One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property.

Create JavaScript Object with Constructor:
Constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword, constructor function allows to create multiple objects.

Using the Object.create method:
Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method.
