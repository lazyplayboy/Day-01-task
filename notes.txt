OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT :

Objects , in Javascript,it's most important data types and forms the building blocks for modern Javascript.

These objects are quite difference from Javascript's primitive data types (Numbers,string,)Boolean,null,  undefined and symbol) in the sence that while these primitine data types all store single value each ( on their types).

Objects are more complexand each object may contain any combination of these primitive data types as well as reference data types.


JavaScript Objects :

Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
            
Numbers can be objects (if defined  with the new keyword)

Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)

Dates are always objects.
